# Status

* version 0.0.0 March 15, 2022

Added several modifications by Adrien Kohlbecker (https://github.com/adrienkohlbecker/wavedrom):

    * narrower skin
    * new repetition syntax to compress signals

 I haven't forked Adrien's repo because I want to try to maintain compatibility with WaveDrom as much as possible (to accept future changes) and because I don't need all of Adrien's changes.
